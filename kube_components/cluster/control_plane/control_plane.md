## What is the Control Plane?

The Control Plane acts as the brain of the cluster. It is responsible for maintaining, managing, and configuring the overall cluster. 

The components within the Control Plane work together to achieve the following:

1. Maintain the [Desired State](./desired_state.md) of the cluster.
2. Manage [Workloads](./workloads.md).
3. Handle [Communication](./communication.md).
